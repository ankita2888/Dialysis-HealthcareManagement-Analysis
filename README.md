# Dialysis-HealthcareManagement-Analysis
Healthcare Analysis on Dialysis Patients was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I've worked on recently.
The project involved leading a data analysis initiative focused on dialysis patient demographics, treatment outcomes, 
and resource utilization within healthcare facilities. I leveraged SQL queries to extract and aggregate patient data from disparate sources, 
including electronic health records and administrative databases. Utilizing Excel for data preprocessing and cleansing ensured data integrity and reliability.
The highlight of the project was designing dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards in Excel, Tableau and Power BI, 
enabling healthcare professionals to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights. Collaborating with cross-functional teams to interpret analysis results and implement data-driven strategies
improved patient care and operational efficiency in healthcare facilities.
